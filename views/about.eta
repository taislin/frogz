      <p>
        <strong>FROGZ</strong> is an **open-source, anti-bloat microhosting service**. We actively oppose the modern "soydev" trend of ultra-complex and bloated webpages, advocating for simplicity and privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For most websites, simple static HTML and CSS files are perfectly sufficient. However, publishing them can be challenging for those without extensive experience. Our core aim is to help everyone create their own internet presence, making this process as simple as possible. With **FROGZ**, you can publish a page with just plain text.
      </p>
      <p>
        **FROGZ** is also an excellent tool for learning web development. You can start with a purely plaintext page, then incrementally add basic HTML, integrate CSS, introduce scripts (on client pages if you choose), and so on, building your skills step-by-step.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can create your own pages using only a password. Subpages can be seamlessly added to a page; for example, if you control `frogz.club/mypage`, you can create unlimited subpages like `frogz.club/mypage/mysubpage`, all managed by the same master password.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can contact us at `contact [at] frogz [dot] club` (Please replace `[at]` with `@` and `[dot]` with `.` to use the email address).
