In an internet dominated by bloat and complexity, **FROGZ** offers a radical alternative: an **open-source, anti-bloat microhosting service**. We champion simplicity, privacy, and user control, opposing the "soydev" trend of ultra-complex, data-hungry webpages.

Our mission is to empower everyone to establish their internet presence with absolute ease. For most simple sites, static HTML and CSS are all that's needed, yet publishing them can be daunting. **FROGZ** simplifies this process, allowing you to publish a page with just plain text.

## Key Concepts & How It Works

-   **Zero-Friction Publishing:** Create your own pages using only a password. No registration, no email, just pure content creation.
-   **Hierarchical Pages:** Build multi-page sites effortlessly. If you control `frogz.club/yourpage`, you can create unlimited subpages like `frogz.club/yourpage/about`, all secured by the same password.
-   **Learn & Grow:** **FROGZ** is a perfect playground for web development beginners. Start with a purely plaintext page, then gradually add [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/), basic HTML, and custom CSS to see your skills evolve.

## Features

**FROGZ** is built on principles of efficiency and freedom:

-   **Absolutely FREE & Ad-Free:** No hidden costs, no disruptive advertisements, ever.
-   **Total Anonymity:** We collect no personal data. Pages are editable with a defined password, ensuring privacy and ease of use.
-   **(Almost) No Censorship:** We stand for free expression. Pages are removed only in [very specific, legally mandated cases](terms).
-   **Open-Source & Community-Driven:** Our code is [Open-Source](https://github.com/taislin/frogz) under the **AGPL-3.0** license. We welcome contributions to keep the web simple and free.
-   **Content Flexibility:** Pages can be crafted using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for simplicity, or you can dive into full HTML for granular control.
-   **Customizable Styles:** Choose from different built-in styles via a dropdown, or apply your own custom CSS to truly make your page unique.
-   **Anti-Bloat Guaranteed:** We've designed **FROGZ** to be as lean as possible. This means:
    -   **No JavaScript on the frontend.**
    -   **No cookies.**
    -   **No trackers.**
    -   **No information recorded beyond the page's contents (not even your IP address).**

## Technology Stack

**FROGZ** relies on a robust and efficient backend, carefully chosen to align with our anti-bloat philosophy:

-   **Backend:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) with [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
-   **Template Engine:** [Eta](https://eta.js.org/) (a lightweight, fast alternative)
-   **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
