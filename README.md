**FROGZ** is an open-source, anti-bloat microhosting service. We oppose modern soydevs and their ultra-complex and bloated webpages.  
  
For most websites, simple static HTML and CSS files are sufficient. Even so, this might be challenging for someone who is not experienced in both. Our aim is to help everyone create their own internet presence, making this process as simple as possible - you can publish a **FROGZ** page with just plain text.  
  
**FROGZ** can also be used to learn web development. You can, for example, start with a purely plaintext page and then start adding basic HTML, then CSS, then scripts, and so on.  
  
You can create your own pages using only a password. Subpages can be added to a page (for example, if you have the password to **frogz.club/mypage** you can create unlimited subpages like **frogz.club/mypage/mysubpage**)
